# Validation

This document owns repeatable validation commands and procedures. It does not claim that a command passed on a tree unless a baseline-specific record says so. Current support lives in [implementation status](implementation-status.md), exact performance results in [performance evidence](performance.md), and closed-tree outcomes in [execution history](../agent/execution/history.md).

## Evidence provenance

Run acceptance from a clean committed tree. Record:

```sh
git status --short --untracked-files=all
git rev-parse HEAD
git rev-parse 'HEAD^{tree}'
```

A command that passed on another commit or an earlier dirty tree is not evidence for the current tree. Local validation and GitHub CI are separate facts; do not claim remote CI passed without observing its actual run.

Use one Cargo process at a time. Do not run `cargo clean`. Keep generated output under the root `target/` or outside the repository.

## Canonical repository gate

The ordinary composite gate is:

```sh
cargo xtask verify
```

`tools/xtask` runs architecture and hygiene policy, formatting, every workspace target, ordinary tests/doctests, mandatory Clippy, API documentation with warnings denied, and benchmark compilation. It does not run statistical measurements or a network-dependent external model.

Useful direct diagnostics are:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo check --workspace --all-targets --locked
cargo test --workspace --locked
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --no-deps --locked
cargo bench --workspace --no-run --locked
git diff --check
```

The mandatory lint profile uses stable selected Clippy policy under `-D warnings`. Nursery remains a separate non-blocking report.

## Phase 10 exact-tree acceptance

Use a fresh dedicated directory beneath the root target without deleting the normal target. The absence check must succeed; if it does not, choose another new child path rather than reusing prior build output:

```sh
test ! -e target/phase10-final
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/target/phase10-final"
```

Run the following sequentially on the clean code-under-test commit:

```sh
cargo metadata --locked --format-version 1 --no-deps

cargo test --locked -p domain-contracts --test allocation
cargo test --locked -p domain-contracts
cargo test --locked -p sampling
cargo test --locked -p inference-runtime
cargo test --locked -p application-runtime
cargo test --locked -p runtime-benchmarks
cargo test --locked -p xtask

cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo bench --workspace --no-run --locked
cargo xtask verify
cargo deny --workspace --locked check advisories bans licenses sources
lychee --config lychee.toml --offline '**/*.md'
git diff --check
```

The `domain-contracts` allocation target is a harness-free executable so libtest/process activity cannot overlap its isolated allocator regions. The sampling package’s ordinary matrix test executes every benchmark case once at every vocabulary size and every stop case once; statistical execution is not required for correctness coverage.

### Portable domain checks

Run both targets because allocation-test configuration and portable package manifests are part of the acceptance boundary:

```sh
cargo check --locked \
    --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
    --lib \
    -p domain-contracts \
    -p tokenization \
    -p context-planner \
    -p sampling \
    -p task-graph

cargo check --locked \
    --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf \
    --lib \
    -p domain-contracts \
    -p tokenization \
    -p context-planner \
    -p sampling \
    -p task-graph
```

### Target and artifact checks

```sh
find . \
    -path './.git' -prune -o \
    -type d -name target -print

test ! -e benchmarks/runtime/Cargo.lock
test ! -d benchmarks/runtime/target

git status --short --untracked-files=all
git status --short --ignored
```

Directories named `target` beneath the root `target/` may be generated documentation artifacts and are valid. A package-local target elsewhere is not. The untracked status must be clean; ignored generated output should be confined to the root target.

## Controlled Phase 10 measurements

Run measurements only after exact-tree acceptance on the same clean code-under-test commit. Raw output remains ignored beneath root `target`; only curated reviewed values enter [performance evidence](performance.md).

### Synthetic baseline

```sh
mkdir -p target/phase10-evidence

cargo run --release --locked \
    -p runtime-benchmarks \
    --bin baseline \
    -- \
    --mode synthetic \
    --warmup 1 \
    --cycles 3 \
    > target/phase10-evidence/synthetic.json
```

The runner writes one JSON report to stdout and progress/summary to stderr. A successful process exit means its fixture, lifecycle, output, cleanup, accounting, unload, shutdown, and join invariants passed; it does not convert synthetic timing into product evidence.

### Focused runtime Criterion measurements

```sh
cargo bench --locked \
    -p runtime-benchmarks \
    --bench runtime \
    -- e0_hosted_checked_prefill/4_tokens

cargo bench --locked \
    -p runtime-benchmarks \
    --bench runtime \
    -- e0_hosted_incremental_decode/1_token_after_2_token_prefill
```

### Focused sampling Criterion measurements

```sh
cargo bench --locked \
    -p sampling \
    --bench sampling_pipeline \
    -- sample_only/default_top_k_top_p/32768

cargo bench --locked \
    -p sampling \
    --bench sampling_pipeline \
    -- restore_and_sample/default_top_k_top_p/32768
```

Do not run the full statistical sampling matrix merely for closure; the ordinary one-shot test owns correctness coverage.

After measurement, verify the commit/tree and clean status again. The JSON’s Git identity and dirty flag should agree with the surrounding Git commands.

## Documentation evidence commit

After measuring Commit A, update only canonical documentation/evidence files and commit them separately as Commit B. State that performance values apply to Commit A and its tree. If Commit B changes only non-executable documentation, Commit A’s measurements remain applicable to the executable tree, but Commit B still requires its own post-commit documentation/canonical gate:

```sh
cargo xtask verify
cargo deny --workspace --locked check advisories bans licenses sources
lychee --config lychee.toml --offline '**/*.md'
git diff --check
```

Record Commit B and its tree in the closure report. A tracked document should not try to contain its own resulting tree hash.

## Repository architecture and hygiene

Run the policy halves independently when diagnosing:

```sh
cargo xtask architecture
cargo xtask hygiene
```

Architecture validates the typed locked workspace graph and exact role/dependency registries. Hygiene validates tracked operational surfaces, manifests, selected dependencies, benchmark layout, nested locks/targets, generated results, caches, and source-tree artifacts. See [dependency policy](dependency-policy.md).

## Download-free focused validation

Ordinary tests and the canonical gate do not resolve or download external models. Useful focused commands are:

```sh
cargo test --locked -p candle-backend
cargo test --locked -p inference-runtime --test native_backend_generation
cargo test --locked -p application-runtime
cargo test --locked -p desktop-slint
```

These tests exercise real-adapter fixture execution plus E0/E1/frontend lifecycle behavior, not external artifact availability, language quality, product performance, GPU execution, or allocation freedom inside upstream libraries.

Fixture regeneration is an explicit maintenance operation, not ordinary validation:

```text
cargo test --locked -p candle-backend --test generate_synthetic_fixture -- --ignored --exact regenerate_committed_candle_fixture
```

Run it only when intentionally replacing the fixture, then review generated files and update provenance hashes in the same change.

## Rust-native Candle Hub smoke

No external performance invocation is currently defined. See [performance evidence](performance.md#external-product-evidence) for the canonical status; compilation cannot satisfy the external baseline prerequisite.

The existing opt-in E1 Hub smoke remains a correctness/lifecycle procedure, not a performance baseline:

```sh
LLM_APP_CANDLE_HUB_SMOKE=1 cargo run --locked -p application-runtime --example candle_hub_smoke
```

It uses `neubla/tiny-random-LlamaForCausalLM` at immutable revision `1c81a3fba044af78df253edc66bdbab183184932`. Running it may access `huggingface.co`, populate the local Hub cache, and use `HF_TOKEN` if required. Never run it without explicit network authorization, never print or commit credentials, and never redistribute cache artifacts.

A future external performance baseline needs its own narrow reviewed opt-in procedure and must actually execute resolution, load, decoded generation, release, unload, and shutdown against an exact model/revision. Successful compilation, cache presence, resolution, or historical smoke output alone is insufficient.

## Dependency, link, and graph audits

```sh
cargo deny --workspace --locked check advisories bans licenses sources
lychee --config lychee.toml --offline '**/*.md'
```

Useful audit reports are:

```sh
cargo metadata --locked --format-version 1
cargo tree --workspace --locked
cargo tree -d --locked
cargo tree -e features --locked
```

Duplicate versions are audit inputs rather than automatic failures. Interpret them against [dependency policy](dependency-policy.md).
